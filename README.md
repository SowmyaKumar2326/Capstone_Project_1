# Capstone_Project_1
KNN regression is a non-parametric method that predicts a numerical value for a given data point based on the values of its k closest neighbors in the training data. The k neighbors can be weighted by their distance to the data point, or by a simple average.
## Overview of the project
This project aims to predict the Price of house using  KNN Regression based on a dataset with 7120 rows and 108 columns. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, balcony presence, total square footage, and various location indicators.
### 1. Data Preprocessing:
Imported necessary packages for analysis. Loaded and explored the dataset. Checked for null values (no null values found). Copied the data for preprocessing.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted correlation analysis. Created a heatmap for selected variables. Visualized data for insights.
### 3. Modelling with KNN Regression:
Selected relevant features for the model. Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn. Evaluated the model with metrics:
R_Square value: 97.07%
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 260.58
## Conclusion:
The KNN Regression model achieved a satisfactory R-squared score of 97.07% indicating its capability to predict the House price in Bangalore. The RMSE value of 206.28 provides an understanding of the model's prediction accuracy. Further analysis and model refinement can be explored to enhance predictive capabilities.

## Predict result for saved model:
Some data was fed into the model and the model predicted the most accurate results for the dataset.
